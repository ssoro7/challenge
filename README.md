# Product Management - Java/Springboot

## Requirements
- Docker (for building and running container images)
- Java JDK11 & Maven (optional, in case you want to run or build the apps on your local machine)
&nbsp;

## Getting started
### Build
Builds container images for both apps
```bash
make build
```
### Run

```bash
make run
```
### Test
Runs unit tests via Maven

## Architecture
This project contains 2 applications:
- Product Service
- Product Review

Users consume the Product Service endpoint `/products` to obtain product information along with product reviews information.
Product Service has a direct dependency on Product Review in order to return enriched data to the users.
In case that the Product Review is unavailable - this causes Product Service to return errors which impacts the user experience.
Both applications expose a healthcheck endpoint at `/actuator/health`.
